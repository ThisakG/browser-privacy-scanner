## What it does

TinyGuard is a lightweight browser extension that monitors websites for hidden trackers and privacy risks while you browse. It provides users with:

Tracker Detection: Identifies third-party domains, analytics scripts, and tracking pixels that may be collecting your data.

Permission Alerts: Flags websites that request excessive permissions or try to access sensitive data.

Privacy Scoring: Gives each site a simple privacy score so users can quickly understand their risk level.

Scan Results: Displays a clean, interactive report showing which trackers were found and why they matter.

Local Storage: All scan data is stored locally on the user’s device — nothing is sent to external servers.

In short: TinyGuard gives you transparency and control over your online privacy, helping you make safer browsing decisions while staying lightweight and non-intrusive.
